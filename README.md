# CubeForge: A Keyforge Cube!

## Intro

CubeForge aims to create a draft mode in Keyforge.
To support this, the _current_ ruleset is as follows:

1.  6 packs of 10 cards per player (300 cards supports 60 * 5 players)
2.  Alliance deck building rules still apply
3.  To add a house to your deck, you must have at least 6 cards from that house. The rest of the house will be filled with the house token in question (see below)

The full card list can be found in the [cards](/cards/) folder, and the card images in each house's subfolder.

## Token Table

When a house in your deck has less than 12 cards (but at least 6), you must fill it up to 12 with that house's associated token.

| House | Token Name | Token Image |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Brobnar | Warrior | ![Warrior](/cards/Brobnar/warrior.png) |
